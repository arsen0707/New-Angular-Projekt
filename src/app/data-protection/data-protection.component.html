<p>A company 's data protection officer should prepare an activity report at least once a year.<br>
    This data protection report documents all measures taken with regard to data protection and IT security in the company.<br>
    With the annual report of the data protection officer, the latter can effectively prove to the management and, if necessary, supervisory authorities that he has fulfilled his obligations.
    <br>
    The data protection report is currently of particular relevance: The activity report of the data protection officer should contain measures that have already been taken to comply with the legal requirements of the DSGVO and the BDSG. If it is a church sponsor, the KDG or DSG-EKD applies.

   <strong> Who has to write a data protection report?</strong><br>
    In principle, there is no legal obligation to prepare an annual activity report for the data protection officer. Nevertheless, he must be able to prove that he has sufficiently fulfilled his duties and has adequately informed and advised the management. All data protection measures taken should therefore be documented on an ongoing basis anyway, especially because of the accountability requirements of the GDPR . This documentation can be bundled into a report once a year.

    What is the use of a data protection report?<br>
    On the one hand, the data protection report serves as proof for the management of the work carried out by the data protection officer and offers those responsible an overview of the current status of data protection in the organization. On the other hand, the data protection officer can prove to the supervisory authority that he is working towards necessary measures and that they have been implemented or rejected by the management. The person responsible also enjoys the advantage of the receipt, because he can also present his data protection efforts to the data protection authority through the report.
    <br>
    A meaningful activity report is also a good opportunity for the data protection officer to draw attention to important issues and motivate those involved. Because the design of the data protection report is open to the data protection officer, the report can be enriched with additional information in such a way that an understanding of the intended measures is generated.</p>
